This repository contains all the things I worked on for the courses COMP2005 (software engineering), COMP3201 (Nature Inspired Computing) 
and COMP2007 (Networking).

The folders AntAco, ConwayGameOfLife and Queens Evolutionary Algorithm are associated with COMP3201, and they contain .jar
files of an Ant Colony Optimization solution designed to explore the Travelling Salesperson Problem, a program for simulating
Conway's Game of Life automata and an evolutionary algorithm for solving the 12 Queen Problem (Variation of 8 Queen problem).

The COMP2005DataBase folder contains the primary implemetation of a SQL database using MySQL in python. The database was designed
to work with a web app. This app was made by a group of 5 people as part of COMP2005.

The folder SocketProgramming contains client and server programs that are designed to work with one another. It includes server side
credential verification and contains an implementation of a queue data structure, with which the client interacts. This was
a part of COMP2007
